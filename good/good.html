Homepage">				</a>			<p>The Rifle Paper Co. has an overall clean and cohesive design with a great use of negative space. They utilize a grid layout to organize their information into a clear hierarchy. Their navigation is easy to find and utilize.</p>			</article>						<article>			<h2 id="zara"><a href="http://www.zara.com/us">Zara</a></h2>			<a href="http://www.zara.com/us/">				<img src="../img/zara.jpg" alt="Zara Homepage">				</a>			<p>Zara's site really achieves their main purpose which is to showcase their merchandise. This is a site that is really dependent upon great photography of the items and the design really allows them to be showcased. With a simple grid layout and a black and white design, they really highlight their products well.

This is usually because there are many different categories and brands, etc. I think that REI really has organized their information well for a clean and easy to navigate site. The simple white background and strategically used photographs really allow the large amount of information to breathe.</p>			</article>		</section>		<footer>			&copy; 2014 The Good The Bad The Ugly		</footer>	</body>	</html>
